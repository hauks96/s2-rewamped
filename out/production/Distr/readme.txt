/**********************************************************************
 *  Step 1.  Explain *briefly* how you implemented brute force.
 *           Describe how you implemented compareTo() and the
 *           slopeTo() methods in the Point data type.
 **********************************************************************/
    1. Brute force implementation:
    Made 4 for loops. Within each of the for loops a point is available.
    Once we have two points we start making slopes between the points.
    If all 3 slopes are the same we have a line between the 4 points.

    2. compareTo()
    The behaviour of the compareTo method can be read directly from the project description.
    If the "this" has smaller y than "that"                   -> this is smaller   -> return -1
    If the "this" has equal y to "that" but a smaller x       -> this is smaller   -> return -1
    If the "this" has equal y to "that" and the x's are equal -> this is larger    -> return  1
    If the "this" has equal y to "that" and the x is larger   -> this is larger    -> return  1

    if ((this.y < that.y) | ((this.y == that.y) & (this.x < that.x))){
                   return -1;
               } else
                   return 1;
           }

    3. slopeTo()



/**********************************************************************
 *  Step 2.  Explain *briefly* how you implemented the sorting solution.
 *           What steps did you do to avoid printing permutations
 *           and subsegments?

 *               You can round to the nearest tenth of a second.
 *
 *  Estimate (using tilde notation) the running time (in seconds) of
 *  your two main functions as a function of the number of points N.
 *
 *  Explain how you derive any exponents.
